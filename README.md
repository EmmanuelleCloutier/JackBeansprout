#  My First Game - End of Semester Project

Here is my very first game, created with colleagues as part of an **end-of-semester project**, designed to be showcased in the **arcade** at my school (Cégep).  
The game was developed in **2D using Unity**, in a **2-player arcade mode**.

##  Game Concept

The game consists of **three levels**:

- **Level 1**:  
  Players must climb the **giant plant** as quickly as possible to earn the most points.

- **Level 2**:  
  Traverse a **randomly generated level** to find the **golden hen** without being caught by **the giant**.  
  If a player gets caught, they must **start the level over**.

- **Level 3** (split into two parts):
  - **Part 1**: Descend the plant as fast as possible.
  - **Part 2**: Click as quickly as possible to **destroy the giant plant**.

At the end of the game, **the player with the most points** is declared the **winner**.
